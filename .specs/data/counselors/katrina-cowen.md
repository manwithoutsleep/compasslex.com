## Long Description

After earning a bachelor's degree in Medical Technology in my 20s, I spent almost three decades along with my husband raising and educating our five children. Following that, I earned my Master's Degree in Mental Health Counseling from Asbury Theological Seminary. My years of experience in discipleship ministry and mentoring in my church brought me face to face with the honest questions that people ask as they confront life's struggles. My own experiences with suffering and challenging transitions led me to pursue a degree in counseling, hoping to help others as I have been helped.

In my counseling work I collaborate with clients to meet them right where they are, conceptualize where they want to be, then plan and implement the steps to reach the goal. I favor an integrative approach that utilizes several evidence-based treatment modalities including narrative-focused trauma care, EMDR, cognitive behavioral therapy, attachment theory and acceptance and commitment therapy/mindfulness. My clinical focus is on working with individual adults navigating issues of anxiety, depression, grief and loss, relationship conflict, and past and present trauma including childhood sexual abuse.

Perhaps you too are facing life transitions, relational struggles or personal suffering. Perhaps a traumatic event from your past has resurfaced, creating distress and distraction in your present life. I am deeply committed to helping you make meaning from your suffering, find redemptive purpose even in tragic circumstances, and live with authenticity.
