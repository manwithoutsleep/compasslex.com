# Kelsi Butcher

## Long Description

Hey there! I'm Kelsi.

If you're reading this, chances are you're facing some tough momentsâ€”whether that's dealing with past trauma, struggling with anxiety or depression, navigating relationship challenges, or just feeling disconnected from your true self. Life's stressors can feel overwhelming, and it's hard to know where to turn.

Through therapy, I believe everyone can build the tools and skills they need to navigate life with confidence.
Although equipped to handle a wide variety of topics, my focus areas include anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and relationship issues. I have a special heart for children and adolescents who may be struggling, but I offer my services to people of any age.

Please let me know how I can be a support to you. My approach is warm and empathetic. Together we can work to identify your goals for counseling and how to move forward to meet those goals. You can do this, and I would love to help!
