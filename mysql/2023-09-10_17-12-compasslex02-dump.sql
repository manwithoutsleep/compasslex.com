Volunteering and working in pastorally focused roles for over two decades has allowed me to integrate the clinical aspects of psychology with the framework of spiritual truth.</p><p>I specialize in couples counseling and trauma related issues such as grief and PTSD. I have a special heart for children or families struggling to recover from divorce and/or blended families trying to make things work.</p><p>As a counselor, my primary mode of psychotherapy is an integrated approach that is custom designed for each client\'s unique needs. This means that I will draw on tools/techniques from the cognitive-behavioral, experiential, structural, narrative, and psychoanalytic schools of thought, although I lean most heavily into attachment theory. When engaged in family therapy, I view the family as a system, which means that the entire system must be respected and understood in order to bring about meaningful change.</p><p>Regardless of what life phase you are in, there are challenging issues that come up.
