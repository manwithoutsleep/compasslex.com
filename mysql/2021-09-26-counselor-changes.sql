I am currently a member of the American Counseling Association, Kentucky Counseling Association and the Christian Association for Psychological Studies. Over the years, my life experiences have created a deep curiosity within me about the narratives and stories of people. My own counseling journey was transformational and this led me to pursuing a counseling degree in the hopes of walking alongside the powerful stories and narratives of my clients.</p><p>My counseling philosophy utilizes an integrative approach coupled with several evidence-based treatment modalities including attachment theory, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), as well as interventions including mindfulness practices and breathing techniques. Collaboration with the client to develop goals that can be implemented together is of utmost importance. My past work with clients have included navigating issues of depression, self-esteem, anxiety, eating disorders, life transitions, relationships, obsessive compusive disorder, sexual abuse and trauma.</p><p>I consider this work a sacred privilege and I am committed to listening, and helping clients find meaning and purpose in the midst of hardship and brokenness. Stories matter and I look forward to working alongside clients in this journey of healing and toward a greater sense of well-being.' WHERE `id` = 5;
