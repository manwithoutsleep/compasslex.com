Volunteering and working in pastorally focused roles for over two decades has allowed me to integrate the clinical aspects of psychology with the framework of spiritual truth.</p><p>I specialize in couples counseling and trauma related issues such as grief and PTSD. I have a special heart for children or families struggling to recover from divorce and/or blended families trying to make things work.</p><p>As a counselor, my primary mode of psychotherapy is an integrated approach that is custom designed for each client's unique needs. This means that I will draw on tools/techniques from the cognitive-behavioral, experiential, structural, narrative, and psychoanalytic schools of thought, although I lean most heavily into attachment theory. When engaged in family therapy, I view the family as a system, which means that the entire system must be respected and understood in order to bring about meaningful change.</p><p>Regardless of what life phase you are in, there are challenging issues that come up. Sometimes you will be able to improve your situation on your own. Other times it takes some outside help. I am committed to providing a safe, confidential, and compassionate environment where individuals, a couple, or an entire family can receive tools to overcome past and present difficulties. Healing is possible, and I'd like to be a part of your journey.</p>";"(859) 721-3259";11321;"In the counseling journey, I hope to come alongside you as you wrestle with the inherent difficulties and struggles associated with life. Damaged relationships, disappointments, insecurities, hurt,trauma, and anxietiesâ€¦ it all can be overwhelming and debilitating as times. But I believe healing is possible!"

I'm Kelsi.</p><p>After obtaining an undergraduate degree in Psychology, I completed the Master's program for Counselor Education at Eastern Kentucky University.</p><p>In addition to my counseling education focusing on clinical skills, I have a deep passion for how the Christian faith intersects with the challenges we face. Following 3 months of intensive training in Christian counseling, I have served for the past 3 years as a lay counselor for a local church.</p><p>Something important that I have learned is that although we can handle some situations in our lives, there are times that we need to seek outside help. I am dedicated to providing all my clients with a safe and confidential environment to discuss whatever you may be wrestling with and providing tools to overcome challenges. Although equipped to handle a wide variety of issues, my focus areas include anxiety, depression, relationship issues, substance abuse, and trauma.
