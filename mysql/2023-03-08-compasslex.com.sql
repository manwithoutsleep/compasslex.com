Volunteering and working in pastorally focused roles for over two decades has allowed me to integrate the clinical aspects of psychology with the framework of spiritual truth.</p><p>I specialize in couples counseling and trauma related issues such as grief and PTSD. I have a special heart for children or families struggling to recover from divorce and/or blended families trying to make things work.</p><p>As a counselor, my primary mode of psychotherapy is an integrated approach that is custom designed for each client\'s unique needs. This means that I will draw on tools/techniques from the cognitive-behavioral, experiential, structural, narrative, and psychoanalytic schools of thought, although I lean most heavily into attachment theory. When engaged in family therapy, I view the family as a system, which means that the entire system must be respected and understood in order to bring about meaningful change.</p><p>Regardless of what life phase you are in, there are challenging issues that come up. Sometimes you will be able to improve your situation on your own. Other times it takes some outside help. I am committed to providing a safe, confidential, and compassionate environment where individuals, a couple, or an entire family can receive tools to overcome past and present difficulties.

I am dedicated to providing all my clients with a safe and confidential environment to discuss whatever you may be wrestling with and providing tools to overcome challenges. Although equipped to handle a wide variety of issues, my focus areas include anxiety, depression, relationship issues, substance abuse, and trauma. I have a special heart for children and adolescents who may be struggling.</p><p>Please let me know how I can be a support to you.

My counseling approach rests on the belief that reaching out for help is a sign of courage and strength. It is normal to need help in difficult times. I am passionate about working with individuals, couples, and families to help them overcome their hurdles. I use a collaborative and respectful style and am committed to creating a therapeutic relationship built on authenticity, trust, and acceptance.</p><p>I would be honored to work with you, so please feel free reach out with any questions about the process.</p>','(770) 262-0635',32663,'Sometimes stress, trauma, hurts, and fears simply pile up.
