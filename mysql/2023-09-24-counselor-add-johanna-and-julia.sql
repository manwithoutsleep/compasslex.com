'<p>Life is hard, and we sometimes need help in navigating the struggles of life. I truly believe that life is not meant to be done alone, and therapy can provide a resource for those feeling alone in their struggles and pain.</p>
<p>I have provided therapy for individuals, couples, and families who were experiencing many different stressors and struggles from relational difficulties to anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>My main focus is on helping you understand the stories that you tell about yourself and helping you process and regain control of your own story. My therapeutic approach uses a combination of several different models and philosophies including Narrative therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), family systems theory, and attachment theory.</p>
<p>In addition to my therapeutic philosophies, I believe that God is present in all our lives and stories as well. For me, this gives a deep meaning to life, and I am honored to be a part of that meaning as a therapist. If you are wondering if therapy might be a helpful resource for you, please don\'t hesitate to reach out and we can see if I may be a good fit for you.</p>',

'<p>After earning two undergraduate degrees in Human Services and Counseling and Christian Ministries, I went on to earn a Master\'s degree in Mental Health Counseling from Asbury Theological Seminary. My goal is to partner with individuals and families in their pursuit of holistic wellness. Life is often full of difficulty and having support while navigating those challenges can be highly beneficial. Iâ€™m dedicated to working with children, adolescents, and adults to identify meaningful life goals and work towards achieving them.</p>
<p>My integrative approach is heavily informed by acceptance and commitment therapy, which combines mindfulness and behavioral change in a way that allows individuals to work towards a flourishing life. I also incorporate aspects of cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical-behavioral therapy into my conceptualization. In the past, I have partnered with adults and children facing a variety of issues, including anxiety, depression, trauma history, grief, relational difficulties, and behavioral difficulties. I believe it\'s extremely important for individuals to feel safe and cared for in counseling, which is why I work to create a nurturing environment where you can thrive.</p>
<p>My hope is that together, we will be able to take another step forward on your journey towards the life you want to live. Contact me today to begin working with you or your child.</p>',
