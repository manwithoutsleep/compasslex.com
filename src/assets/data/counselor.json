After graduating with an undergraduate degree in education, I subsequently realized the last thing I wanted to do with my life was become a teacher. After some time, I discovered that a career in which I could get to know people on a deep and genuine level would be a good fit for me. My own experience with darkness has been one that brought me to seek professional help and has grown a desire in me for others to experience the healing and transformation that I have through counseling. Upon reflection of my life, I have learned that suffering and pain can be a gift from God. I have always been comfortable in conversations that may seem a bit heavy on the outside looking in and find joy in experiencing this with my clients.</p><p>My philosophical approach to the therapeutic relationship is an integrated one which is heavily driven by a mode of therapy labeled Internal Family Systems (IFS). This type of therapy holds the belief that our true self can be accessed through the unburdening of emotions, memories, and beliefs associated with our deepest hurts. I also offer EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapy, which is a tool that offers a tangible way to heal from the symptoms and distress that are the result of trauma and adverse life experiences. My experience includes working with those who have faced challenges with PTSD, depression, anxiety, relationship issues, suicidal ideation/self-harm, homicidal ideation, anger, and chronic pain.</p><p>Whether you find yourself in pain, confused, outraged, numb, apathetic, etc., I can assure you that all parts of your being are welcome. It would genuinely be a joy for me to journey with you as you navigate your own unique circumstances, whatever they might be.</p>",

Having spent many years leading a women's Bible study group, I had a desire to learn how to make a difference for hurting women, married couples, and families. I earned my Master of Arts in Marriage and Family Counseling from Asbury Theological Seminary.</p><p>My person-centered integrated approach is largely attachment based and pulls from tried-and-true modalities such as Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) for individuals, couples, and families as well as Gottman couples therapy, family systems theory, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), and more. I have been privileged to come alongside those suffering with depression, anxiety, grief, low self-worth, and shame. I utilize the Prepare/Enrich assessment for those seeking premarital counseling and have worked with those struggling with sexual identity, marriage difficulties, family isolation, and emotional distance.</p><p>I believe strongly that the Lord sees us in our pain and suffering and the Holy Spirit is present with us in the counseling room. As spiritual beings, it is important that we integrate faith and the practice of sound, evidenced-based counseling principles. As we work together to sort through the challenges you're facing, we will set goals that will help you get where you'd like to be as a person made in the image of God, whether individually, as a married couple, or as a family. May the Lord bless you as you take this first step toward counseling for a better future. I look forward to our work together!</p>",

I have a special heart for children or families struggling to recover from divorce and/or blended families trying to make things work.</p><p>As a counselor, my primary mode of psychotherapy is an integrated approach that is custom designed for each client's unique needs. This means that I will draw on tools/techniques from the cognitive-behavioral, experiential, structural, narrative, and psychoanalytic schools of thought, although I lean most heavily into attachment theory. When engaged in family therapy, I view the family as a system, which means that the entire system must be respected and understood in order to bring about meaningful change.</p><p>Regardless of what life phase you are in, there are challenging issues that come up. Sometimes you will be able to improve your situation on your own. Other times it takes some outside help. I am committed to providing a safe, confidential, and compassionate environment where individuals, a couple, or an entire family can receive tools to overcome past and present difficulties. Healing is possible, and I'd like to be a part of your journey.</p>",
