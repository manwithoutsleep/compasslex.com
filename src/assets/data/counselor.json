After graduating with an undergraduate degree in education, I subsequently realized the last thing I wanted to do with my life was become a teacher. After some time, I discovered that a career in which I could get to know people on a deep and genuine level would be a good fit for me. My own experience with darkness has been one that brought me to seek professional help and has grown a desire in me for others to experience the healing and transformation that I have through counseling. Upon reflection of my life, I have learned that suffering and pain can be a gift from God. I have always been comfortable in conversations that may seem a bit heavy on the outside looking in and find joy in experiencing this with my clients.</p><p>My philosophical approach to the therapeutic relationship is an integrated one which is heavily driven by a mode of therapy labeled Internal Family Systems (IFS). This type of therapy holds the belief that our true self can be accessed through the unburdening of emotions, memories, and beliefs associated with our deepest hurts. I also offer EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapy, which is a tool that offers a tangible way to heal from the symptoms and distress that are the result of trauma and adverse life experiences. My experience includes working with those who have faced challenges with PTSD, depression, anxiety, relationship issues, suicidal ideation/self-harm, homicidal ideation, anger, and chronic pain.</p><p>Whether you find yourself in pain, confused, outraged, numb, apathetic, etc., I can assure you that all parts of your being are welcome. It would genuinely be a joy for me to journey with you as you navigate your own unique circumstances, whatever they might be.</p>",

Having spent many years leading a women's Bible study group, I had a desire to learn how to make a difference for hurting women, married couples, and families. I earned my Master of Arts in Marriage and Family Counseling from Asbury Theological Seminary.</p><p>My person-centered integrated approach is largely attachment based and pulls from tried-and-true modalities such as Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) for individuals, couples, and families as well as Gottman couples therapy, family systems theory, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), and more. I have been privileged to come alongside those suffering with depression, anxiety, grief, low self-worth, and shame. I utilize the Prepare/Enrich assessment for those seeking premarital counseling and have worked with those struggling with sexual identity, marriage difficulties, family isolation, and emotional distance.</p><p>I believe strongly that the Lord sees us in our pain and suffering and the Holy Spirit is present with us in the counseling room. As spiritual beings, it is important that we integrate faith and the practice of sound, evidenced-based counseling principles. As we work together to sort through the challenges you're facing, we will set goals that will help you get where you'd like to be as a person made in the image of God, whether individually, as a married couple, or as a family. May the Lord bless you as you take this first step toward counseling for a better future. I look forward to our work together!</p>",

            "longdescription": "<p>Hi, I'm Sherry.</p><p>After years of serving as a school counselor I saw a need for more individual and group support from a clinical aspect. I found myself with a deep passion for helping people find their inner peace and their peace with others even outside the school setting. This desire to support children and adults on their journey of overcoming obstacles and working through tough challenges led me to pursue my clinical counseling licensure.</p><p>Following a Bachelor's Degree in Education from University of Kentucky, I also earned a Rank 1 Certification with double Master's Degrees in Counseling and Administration at Eastern Kentucky University. Making the transition from working entirely in a school setting, I became a Licensed Professional Counselor Associate in March of 2023.</p><p>In the counseling process I utilize an integrative approach that draws on various interventions from the Cognitive Behavioral (CBT) field, Dialectical and Behavior Therapy (DBT) Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and Internal Family Systems (IFS). It is also important to me as a counselor to integrate Christian faith into the counseling process to the degree the client wishes. Helping children and adults with issues of bereavement has become a specialty area for me, and I am also contracted with the Kentucky Center for Grieving Children and Families.</p><p>When I am not counseling you can find me enjoying hobbies such as traveling, reading, spending time with family and friends, and walking and being a part of nature</p>",

            "longdescription": "<p>Hi, I'm Kyra.</p><p>I have a heart for helping couples deepen their bonds, restore trust, and establish the security needed to see their relationship thrive. Whether you're rebuilding after betrayal, navigating loss, or simply longing to feel close again, I aim to create a space where both partners feel seen, valued, and empowered to grow - together. And, because I believe an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, I also love working with couples who are in the early stages of their relationship and want to build strong foundations together. Additionally, I work with individuals navigating identity crises and life transitions or struggling with the effects of anxiety, depression, co-dependency or trauma. </p><p>In our work together, we'll get curious about patterns and where they come from while gently helping you to separate from the labels and negative core beliefs that are keeping you from living from a place of security and connection. I often take an eclectic approach, tailoring therapy to your unique needs and goals while keeping a relational and systemic focus. I draw primarily from Emotionally Focused Therapy, Internal Family Systems, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to support my clients as they learn to understand themselves and others better, build secure connections, and foster holistic well-being. Regardless of the method I use, I endeavor to always let empathy, compassion, and humble curiosity lead in my work with individuals and couples. </p><p>I'm interested in getting to the root of the problem—not just treating symptoms. It's not just about finding quick fixes; it's about getting to the heart of the matter and creating lasting change. I help clients recognize that the places where they feel stuck or lost are often a result of adaptive patterns that once served to protect them but that have since become limiting or debilitating. My goal is to cultivate a safe and compassionate therapeutic space to process your experiences through a depathologizing lens, reconnect with your inner wisdom, and move forward with hope and a felt sense of security in your relationships and in who you are.</p>",
