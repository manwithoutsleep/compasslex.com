            <div class="ui-card-body">If you have registered online with one of our counselors, new client forms are available online. If you are unable to access the online forms, please please print out the New Client Registration Form by clicking on the button on the left. Please fill out this form prior to meeting with your counselor in order to better prepare you for your time together. If you are coming in for a Couples Session, please also complete the short couples form. If you don't have a chance to complete the registration forms, we'll take a few minutes at the beginning of your session to get that taken care of.</div>
